        <h4 class="text-title">About Nanjing</h4>
        <p>Nanjing is the capital of east China’s Jiangsu Province. It was the
          capital of various ancient Chinese dynasties and forms an important
          part of the Chinese history and culture. Located in the lower basin of
          Yangtze River and the Yangtze River Delta economic zone, it’s one of
          the most important cities in China. It was one of the four great
          ancient capitals of China. For example, in the Three Kingdom’s period,
          Wu State established its capital here. Maybe in the race you would
          gradually indulge yourself in the historic atmosphere of Nanjing and
          be inspired to race stronger.</p>
